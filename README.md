# SeniorProject2021
UF Senior Project
Senior Project for the class CIS/CEN4917 CISE Design & Senior Project -Fall 2021
The purpose of the project was to train models on sawgrass roots to compare to the previously created models which were trained on a larger sample of peanut roots and with transfer learning were trained on a smaller sample of sawgrass roots.
A demo of the models can be ran from Demo.py or from Demo-jupyter.ipynb
Due to GitHub size limitations, the models are stored on a Google Drive. The models can be downloaded from here:
