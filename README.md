# SeniorProject2021
UF Senior Project

Senior Project for the class CIS/CEN4917 CISE Design & Senior Project -Fall 2021

The purpose of the project was to train models on sawgrass roots to compare to the previously created models which were trained on a larger sample of peanut roots and with transfer learning were trained on a smaller sample of sawgrass roots.

A demo of the models can be ran from Demo.py or from Demo-jupyter.ipynb

Due to GitHub size limitations, the models are stored on a Google Drive. The models can be downloaded from here:

The fileCleaner will take PAT files and check to see if previous root data is in PAT files. 
The GenerateGT will take the PAT files and create the Ground Truth images if there is a data in the PAT file.
